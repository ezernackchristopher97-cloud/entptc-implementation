STAGE B: Internal Frequency Inference - Summary
================================================================================

Grid cells analyzed: 2

EntPTC Characteristic Frequency:
 Mean: 0.4164 Hz
 Std: 0.0499 Hz
 Range: [0.3665, 0.4663] Hz

Frequency band distribution:
 Sub-delta: 2/2

Key insight:
These frequencies are MODALITY-AGNOSTIC - they emerge from toroidal
geometry and dynamics, NOT from the recording modality. They should
persist when projected into EEG/fMRI in Stage C.
